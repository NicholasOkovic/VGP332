make players spawn in a certain place	

make players actually collect something 

players go back to base 

when player sees other player with food run into them to take food 

make a deposite strat for both

make 2 teams

make map

give them fsm

create the missing strats





Logic:
team 1 goes to center to collect mineral, then heads back to base to deposite mineral
team 2 tries to run into team 1 to steal their mineral to deposite at their own base




bugs:
raven wont switch states, stays at go home

decrease size of crow carrier




Map backup
