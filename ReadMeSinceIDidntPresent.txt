Final Artificial Intelligence assignment:

2 Teams: Ravens(Top left), Crows(Bottom Right)

Main Goal: Get As many minerals as possible!



Ravens:
Description: These clever birds know where to go to collect their minerals, sadly they aren't very strong and keep
getting them stolen!

How they get minerals:
Ravens collect minerals from mushroom deposites

Abilities:
Raven can collect minerals from deposites, knows where those deposites are, and are patient and will wait around the
deposite area for more to spawn

Crows:
Description: The stronger crows wander from place to place looking to steal minerals from the more intellegent ravens.

How they get minerals:
Crows will chase after ravens if they are holding minerals, if not, they leave them alone.

Abilities:
Crows are much faster than the ravens, have a stealing ability, have a larger and wider sight cone




The bug I could fix:
Raven have a small chance to not make it to a mushroom deposite and get stuck.
